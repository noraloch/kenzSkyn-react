## What is the purpose for this project?

This is a sample that shows the basic structure a README should have. It should be updated as standards change and should aim to be as succinct as possible.

## Usage examples

If usage examples are relevant for your project, they should be included very early on in the README. The README should be optimized to bootstrap people as fast as possible towards the common use case.

## Prerequisites

If you are assuming anything about the environment, list it here, e.g.

- JDK 8u152

## Installing Dependencies

This should be one command that can be used to install dependencies specific to this project, e.g.

`npm install`

## Running

This should be one command that can be used to run the project (if it is runnable), e.g.

`./bin/run.sh`

## Running Tests

This should be one command that can be used to run the automated tests, e.g.

`mvn test`

Tests are run both on CI and in local development. If there are any differences here, please call them out.
READMEs should focus on developer experience so optimize for describing the recommended developer flow vs ideal case scenarios 
in isolated systems (i.e. CI)

If static analysis is run outside of tests, there should be a section on how to run that as well.

## Building

This should be one command that can be used to build the project (if it is buildable)

`npm run build`

## Development Mode

If the project has a "development mode" (i.e. a non-production way to run that optimizes for developer experience), list the command here, e.g.

`./bin/watch.sh`

## Deploying

What are the steps necessary to deploy the built artifact (if there is a built artifact). Deployments needs to occur reproducibly via a central CI system, the instructions here should represent that.

*Make sure to describe where the artifacts are located and how to verify they are available*
